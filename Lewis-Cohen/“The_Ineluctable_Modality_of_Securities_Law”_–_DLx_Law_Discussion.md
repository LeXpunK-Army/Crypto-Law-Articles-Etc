There were issues of material fact as to whether  the sale of a condominium by Dubois, the appellee real estate broker, to Hocking, the appellant purchaser, and the related components of the package offered to Hocking were part of one scheme or transaction, whether there was a common enterprise, and whether there was the expectation of profits produced by the efforts of others. Hocking claimed that the condominium was promoted by Dubois ""with an emphasis on the economic benefits to be derived from the managerial efforts of third parties designated or arranged for by Dubois,"" and by including with the condominium an offer for a rental arrangement or rental pool arrangement the entire package constituted a security. Dubois argued that the sale of the condominium was separate and distinct from the rental pooling arrangement and there was no investment of money in the RPA and that the RPA allowed Hocking to control the condominium such that he was not reliant on the efforts of others.

“The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law” – DLx Law Discussion Draft Nov. 10, 2022

In the course of researching for this Article, we reviewed approximately 256 articles, law reviews, and practitioner publications on the subject of investment contracts and the definition of the term “security” under federal securities laws, many of which were not directly cited in this Article.  The following list comprises those articles which we found relevant to our review, grouped in alphabetical order by the first listed author’s last name, and separated into two groups: First, scholarship which did not contemplate crypto assets, and second, scholarship which focused on the application of the investment contract doctrine to crypto assets.
